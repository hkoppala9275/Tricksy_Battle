The Tricksy Battle

In the terminal, a straightforward two-player card game is played. applies all of the fundamental "Tricksy Battle" rules:


A 48-card deck is used (Kings removed).  
Each player is dealt eight cards. Each player takes turns leading a card; if they can, the follower must do the same. The highest card in the lead suit wins the trick and scores a point.  
One card is revealed from the deck following each trick, and the winner of each trick advances to the next round.  
Each player draws four more cards when both hands drop to four cards (twice).  
After 16 rounds or when one player scores 9 points and the other has ≥1 point, the game is over.  
The zero-point player "shoots the moon" and wins with 17 points if the final score is 16–0.
